\chapter{Conclusion}

\hspace{15mm}In this final year project, the development of a social network library written in a low-level language is presented. This library enables a developer to authenticate his application on \textbf{Twitter}, but also to receive and send text-based messages called \textit{tweets}.

This features has been tested on the simulator of a lightweight operating system: \textbf{FreeRTOS}, which prove the portability and the partial independence of the library, and thus it is suitable for embedded devices.

All the objectives of this project has been achieved. The functional goal was to perform a communication between Twitter and an application thanks to the library. Moreover, the personal aim was to improve my knowledge in low-level development and become familiar with the C language, and this is precisely what is happened.

This project allows any interested developer to work on further improvements. The source code will still open to use and modification by other people.
