\chapter{Conclusion}

\hspace{15mm}In this final year project, I have presented the development of a social network library written in a low-level language. This library enables a developer to authenticate his application on \textbf{Twitter}, but also to receive and send text-based messages called \textit{tweets}.

This features has been tested on the simulator of a lightweight operating system: \textbf{FreeRTOS}, which proves the portability and the partial independence of the library, therefore it is suitable for embedded devices.

All the objectives of this project have been achieved. The functional goal was to perform a communication between Twitter and an application thanks to the library. Moreover, my personal aim was to improve my knowledge in low-level development and to become familiar with the C language, and this is precisely what happened.

This project allows any interested developer to work on further improvements. The source code will still be open for use and modification by other people.
