\section{Project aim and personal goal}

% Is my goal achieved, why/why not?

\hspace{15mm}The main aim of this project was to develop library that is able to grab data from a social network, Twitter. This part of the goal has been achieved, as a mater of fact my library enables a developer to get a user timeline and send tweets after granted access using the appropriate authentication protocol.

Regarding the portability, the library might be used by any device or any system. Nevertheless, two dependencies are required: OpenSSL and libcurl which are both also portable.

This library has also been build in order to be reused or integrated to another project. Every piece of the project has been documented and this report has also been made to provide a support as regards of the way it works. The source code and the report are freely available on Github.
