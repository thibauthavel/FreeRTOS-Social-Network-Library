\chapter{Methodology}

\hspace{15mm}My initial approach was to become familiar with the embedded device technology. I had to find an adapted, a small and a simple operating system to work with, thereby I chose \textbf{FreeRTOS}\footnote{FreeRTOS is a light-weight Real-Time Operating System.} supported from my supervisor.

(Existing library: no -> become familiar with FreeRTOS -> search about the way to development my own library: protocols, useful libraries -> parallel tests and design -> implementation -> final testing)

(Designed along the research, tests, and implementation)
% If enought time left : fit this with existing method
