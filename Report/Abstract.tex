\part{Abstract}

The main aim of this project is to develop a low-level library that is able to grab and store data from a social network. This library works in an embedded device and stored data had to be used to provide a simple service. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the final library, I created a demo service that interacts with a known social network (for example, Twitter).
