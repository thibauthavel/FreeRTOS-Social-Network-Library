\section{Functional design}

\subsection{Interactions with Twitter}

- Send, receive and store tweets from Twitter.


\subsection{Easy layer to user}

- Don't need to know how works neither OAuth, nor OpenSSL, nor Libcurl, nor the XML parser.
- Whole authentication in only one function.
- Send using authentication entity in only one function.
- Receive and parse XML results using authentication entity, in only one function.

\section{Implementation design}

\subsection{Required libraries}

- OAuth which use OpenSSL and Libcurl are required.
- OAuth and OpenSSL could be both included in the final library package.
- The use of Libcurl could be replace by sockets.


\subsection{Diagram of the library}

- UML-like representation of the way it will work
