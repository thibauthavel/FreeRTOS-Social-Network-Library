\section{Operating System: FreeRTOS}

\subsection{Overview}

(Quick overview of the system: Free, open source, GP Licence, light-weight)


\subsection{Real-Time System}

(Kernel mechanism: priorities and scheduling)


\subsection{Libraries}

(Existing libraries: non-free libraries for specific hardware, light system library)


\subsection{POSIX simulator}

(Compilation of a library and a task)

\section{Twitter authentication: OAuth protocol}

\subsection{Overview}

(Common authentication mechanism: token, secret key system, include graphic representations)


\subsection{Existing library in C}

(Downloaded and tested library: samples hard to understand, idea: create a simple-to-use library layer)


\subsection{Register an application on Twitter}

(Way and proprieties of the registered application)


\subsection{Required libraries}

(libcurl: overview and it's seem hard to adapt to FreeRTOS, idea: create a very simple HTTP request library)\\
(OpenSSL: overview and it's seem hard to adapt to FreeRTOS, idea)
