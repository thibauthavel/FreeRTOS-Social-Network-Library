\chapter{Introduction}

\hspace{15mm}Our society tends to use more and more social networks (for instance, Twitter or Facebook). At the same time, we are increasingly dependent on the use of embedded devices on a day-to-day basis (for instance, home automation). The goal of this project is to develop a platform that allows an effective and efficient communication between embedded devices and social networks.

The main aim is to develop a low-level library that is able to grab and store data from a social network. This library works in an embedded device and stored data has been used to provide a simple service. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the final library, I created a demo service that interacts with a known social network: Twitter.

One of my personal objectives was to improve my knowledge in low-level development and become familiar with the C language. Also I was looking forward to improving my software development skill while working with a very specific hardware.

Firstly, this report will present the way I started my initial research and how I designed the library according to my functional choices. Secondly, it will present how I've implemented these functionalities, and what I did to test my library. Finally, this report will end by an evaluation of the final product regarding the design choices, the way I've implemented them, and his reliability.
